# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Contact Information
- **Primary Contact:** Jordan Ehrig - jordan@ehrig.dev
- **Response Time:** Within 24 hours for critical issues
- **Secure Communication:** Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting

## Vulnerability Handling

### Severity Levels
- **Critical:** Remote code execution, data breach potential, image processing exploits
- **High:** Privilege escalation, authentication bypass, API key exposure
- **Medium:** Information disclosure, denial of service, resource exhaustion
- **Low:** Minor issues with limited impact

### Response Timeline
- **Critical:** 24 hours
- **High:** 72 hours  
- **Medium:** 1 week
- **Low:** 2 weeks

## Security Measures

### ComfyUI Integration Security
- Secure ComfyUI API communication
- Input validation for image generation parameters
- File upload sanitization and validation
- Resource limits for image processing
- Temporary file cleanup
- Safe model loading and execution

### Image Processing Security
- Input validation on all image parameters
- File type restrictions and validation
- Image size and dimension limits
- Safe temporary directory usage
- Memory usage controls
- Processing timeout enforcement

### MCP Security
- Environment-based credential injection only
- No API keys in source code
- Rate limiting on generation endpoints
- Authentication and authorization controls
- Audit logging for all operations
- Secure error handling

## Incident Response Plan

### Detection
1. **Automated:** Resource monitoring alerts, processing errors
2. **Manual:** User reports, code review findings
3. **Monitoring:** Unusual generation patterns or resource usage

### Response
1. **Assess:** Determine severity and system impact
2. **Contain:** Isolate affected components
3. **Investigate:** Root cause analysis
4. **Remediate:** Apply fixes and patches
5. **Recover:** Restore normal operations
6. **Learn:** Post-incident review and improvements

## Security Audits

### Regular Security Reviews
- **Code Review:** Every pull request
- **Dependency Scan:** Weekly automated scans
- **Security Testing:** On every release
- **Performance Testing:** Resource usage monitoring

### Last Security Audit
- **Date:** 2025-07-03 (Initial setup)
- **Scope:** Architecture review and security template deployment
- **Findings:** No issues - initial secure configuration
- **Next Review:** 2025-10-01
